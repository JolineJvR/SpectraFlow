Create an attractive and user-friendly interface using React components.
● Implement a search input where users can enter a search term and also
select the type of media they want to search for (e.g. movie, podcast, music,
audiobook, short film, TV show, software, ebook, or all).
● Implement a favourites list where users can add and remove items. The list
of favourite content does not need to be remembered when the user exits
your web application.
● All output results should be attractively displayed.
Back-end:
● Use Node.js with the Express framework to create the server to serve your
React front-end and handle API requests.
● Implement a route that communicates with the iTunes Search API to fetch
music data based on user queries. Retrieve album information including
album name, artist name, album cover image, and release date.
● Pass the API endpoints data to the front-end as needed to display results to
the user.
● Use JWT to authorise API requests and secure your API.
Take Note:
● You do not have to authenticate users.
● You do not have to create a database for this application.
● No information about the users of your application, their favourites list, nor
their history activity needs to be stored by your application after the user
leaves the app
